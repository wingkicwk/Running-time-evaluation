# Running-time-evaluation
In this project, various data structures to are implemented determine the amount of resources (such as time and storage) necessary to execute a particular algorithm. Specifically, 5 tasks are implemented:
-Writing factorial algorithms using three different approaches(iterative,tail amd non tail recursive)
-Plotting their running time
-Use one of the above sequence as input to write binary search algorithm using two different appraoches(iterative and recursive)
-Computing and plotting their running time
-Use curve-fitting algorithms to find the equation of the running times plotted above In the following parts, solutions for the tasks will be shown step by step with explaination of each algorithm implemented and each decision made.
Unit tests are also provieded to test the key functionality of the program
